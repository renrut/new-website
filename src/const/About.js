export const ABOUT_ME = (<div><p>I am a software developer from Brevard, NC with a diverse range of work experience. My most recent role involved serving as a Summer Camp Director, where I oversaw technology and facilities operations. Before my stint as a Summer Camp Director, I worked in the fast-paced, agile environment of Amazon Advertisement, specializing in (Big) Data Delivery and prior to that, I worked on Amazon Alexa, where my responsibilities included creating and maintaining highly scalable and highly available services.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with technology that captures my interest and I am an avid outdoor enthusiast who enjoys skiing, running, and flying my paragliding. Additionally, I spend time woodworking in my small shop, where I am currently constructing a campervan with my wife.</p></div>)

export const ABOUT_WEBSITE = (<div><p>This website is a tribute to Super Mario 64, one of the first video games I ever played and still one of my all-time favorites and I thought it would be funny if I put my head on it. To paraphrase Jurassic Park, "I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could, I didn't stop to think if I should."</p><p>With that in mind, I created a 3D model of my head using photogrammetry and Blender. I applied a comic book filter to the texture in an attempt to make the model less unsettling, although I'm not entirely convinced it was successful in removing the creepiness factor!</p><p>I have additional plans for updates, so please check back periodically to see them and thank you for your interest!</p></div>)
